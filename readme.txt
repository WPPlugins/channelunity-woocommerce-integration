ChannelUnity saves time and enables increased sales by integrating WooCommerce with
marketplaces including Amazon, eBay, Rakuten, NewEgg and Tesco


== Description ==

Selling through multiple online channels is fast becoming standard practice for online sellers
in the know about maximising their sales figures. Historically it was the case that each 
additional channel created a great deal more management work and, in many cases, a 
greater cost than additional sales really justified. Since 2009 Magento, Shopify and 
Bigcommerce users have been trusting ChannelUnity to automate managing single or 
multiple marketplaces, save them time and give them the opportunity to increase sales.
